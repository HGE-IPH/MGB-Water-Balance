# MGB-Water-Balance
MGB Water Balance plugin has the objective of carrying out the water balance of the MGB hydrological model simulations. From the water balance, it is possible to verify basic results such as rain, discarge and evapotranspiration in absolute and relative values for the simulated basin.
